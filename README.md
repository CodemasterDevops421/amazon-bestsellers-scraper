# Amazon Best Sellers Crawler

The Amazon Best Sellers crawler visits the main categories listed on the Amazon Best Sellers page. It extracts the 50 top-selling items from each category, complete with information such as name, price, URL, and a thumbnail image.

If more information, such as item description or availablity, is required, the source code can be modified to include those.

## Sample result

```json
{
    "category": "Amazon.co.uk Best Sellers: The most popular items in Automotive",
  "categoryUrl": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Best-Sellers-Car-Motorbike/zgbs/automotive/ref=zg_bs_nav_0/260-1736080-5985605",
  "items": {
    "0": {
      "name": "Carplan De-Ionised Water 5L - DIW005",
      "price": "Â£2.00",
      "url": "https://www.amazon.co.uk/Carplan-Diw005-De-Ionised-Water-5Ltr/dp/B000C74XPE/ref=zg_bs_automotive_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=GPZ6732XW8DK82NK8CZM",
      "thumbnail": "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51VKKEz-DeL._AC_UL200_SR200,200_.jpg"
    },
}
```

## Input parameters


## Proxy

For the actor to function properly, proxies are required. It is not recommended to run the actor on a free account for more than obtaining sample results. If you plan to run the actor for more than a few results, subscribe to the Apify platform and receive access to a large pool of proxies.

## Additional options

#### Number of results

To limit the number of results that are extracted, set this value to the number of results you need. Otherwise, keep it blank or at 0. 

This setting is not 100% accurate. Due to concurrent crawling of pages, one or two extra results per crawl will be returned.
